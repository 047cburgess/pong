    
i prefer asking before doing modifications:

i don't send the id to the user its the Auth same as realname
so id realname email and password should be Private Info
realname should be usable to log-in in place of the email ?

avatar_url is just /user/avatars/:username.webp (all the avatars are converted to webp)
```tsp

  model MutablePublicInfo {
    username: Username;
    realname?: string;
    avatarUrl?: url;
  }

  model PublicInfo extends MutablePublicInfo {
    @doc("id = 0 is reserved for non-registered users")
    @key
    id: Id;

    lastSeen?: utcDateTime;
    registeredSince?: utcDateTime;
  }
```

is it usefull ? i have no routes corresponding in user and except username 
nothing gonna change 
: 
```tsp
	@patch
    update(
      @body body: UserInfoPatch,
    ): void | BadRequestResponse | UnauthorizedResponse;

```
same for i don't see the usage
```
    @doc("Check friendship state between the current user and the target")
    @get
    state(@path username: Username):
      | {
          state: "friends" | "outgoing" | "incoming";
        }
      | NotModifiedResponse
      | UnauthorizedResponse
      | NotFoundResponse;
```
